# UltimaV-tileset
Tileset graphics mod for Ultima V map [Britannia](https://github.com/hackedpassword/Nextgen-Maps#britannia-overworld), and a component of the (wip) U5 mod.

Behold, compare original Ultima V to this first prototype:

What should stand out the most is that you don't see hex tiles, only "square" tiles. This is an intended and tricky effect to mimic the original looks.

It's only the beginning. Give this mod a star :star: if you like the retro concept!
