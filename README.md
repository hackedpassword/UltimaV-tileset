# Ultima V tileset -> retroset

This mod has been migrated to [Ultima V retroset](https://github.com/hackedpassword/UltimaV-retroset). Updates here are only for my 800+ turn game that uses this mod, since mods cannot be swapped mid-game.

Ethereal borders is baked into this mod.

Makes for a decent beta testing ground too!
