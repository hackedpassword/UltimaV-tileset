	/* In making this tileset, the goal had been absolute adherence to G&K entities w/o introducing new ones. The goal bent entities
	    a bit with new combo entities like Desert+Flood plains.png to patch in sprites with correct representation in U5 but yet
	    retaining the very same G&K behaviors. I'm doing a new quality pass updating bridges and find the dynamics of river limitations,
	    river/static-shaded coloring, proximity to land or water, it's time to do something that G&K should have done long ago: "Plains"
	    are now a legit occurence for Flood plains, vs only Desert. By doing this, I can negate tile edging at coasts which otherwise
	    adds undesired edge gfx where a river should visibly flow through, since Plains are only used for path terrainfeature tiles.
	    Options are very limited - making a bridge into a special wonder dual land/water tile is an option, including setting by use
	    of canal improvement'ing. Not being concerned about random placement is a huge advantage. The block below is duped from G&K w/
	    the single addition of Plains. */
